In this project we apply Natural Language prerocessing techniques like lemmatization, tokenization, stopword removal
and stemming on movie reviews to cluster data using KMeans and Dendogram plots and recommend the most likely movie 
to one the user has chosen. Data is extracted from IMDB and Wikipedia and merged in one. Packages used are Spacy and NLTK.
